Trouble shooting Heroku with Alexis

express must have been installed globally on my machine
because the package.json didn't have it!!

I did `npm uninstall -g express` so that doesn't happen again

--

JAWSDB_MARIA_URL was chosen in Heroku->Resources and matched
in connection.json

--

.env
    SESSION_SECRET= XXXXXXX
    ^ also needed to be added below JAWSDB_MARIA_URL in Heroku
