## Description

The Tech Blog CMS is a specialized platform designed for developers aiming to publish articles, blog posts, and share their expertise on various technical topics. Built around the MVC model, this system utilizes Handlebars.js for templating, Sequelize as the ORM, and incorporating the express-session npm package for authentication.

Note:  CSS is minimal.  May dive deeper in future.  Time is of the essence...
